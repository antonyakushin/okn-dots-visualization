# MdDS
The purpose of this project is to help researchers of MdDS (Mal de Débarquement Syndrome) treat patients and find a cure.

A common treatment involves the patient watching stripes moving across a screen. This repository is intended to provide this treatment in a browser- and platform-independent way through a user-friendly customizable web application. The application uses only HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, which means it can be run in any modern browser or mobile device.

The latest source code can be downloaded for offline use [here](http://mdds.nyc/app/MdDS.zip). After downloading, unzip the downloaded file to a location on your computer and open index.html in your web browser.

# System Requirements
On Windows and Mac, this application supports the latest versions of the following browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. Mobile device support varies by device and vendor (the latest versions of major mobile browsers are typically supported). This application works in browsers which support HTML5 Canvas and requestAnimationFrame().

# What is Mal de Debarquement?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_de_debarquement): Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a rare neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase "mal de débarquement" is French for "Sickness from Disembarkation". MdDS is typically diagnosed by a Neurologist or an Ear Nose & Throat Specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience.
