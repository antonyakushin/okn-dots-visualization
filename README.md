# MdDS
The purpose of this project is to help researchers of MdDS (Mal de Débarquement Syndrome) treat patients and find a cure.

A common treatment involves the patient watching stripes moving across a screen. This repository is intended to provide this treatment in a browser- and platform-independent way through a user-friendly customizable web application. The application uses only HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, which means it can be run in any modern browser or mobile device.

# What is Mal de Debarquement?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_de_debarquement): Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a rare neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase "mal de débarquement" is French for "Sickness from Disembarkation". MdDS is typically diagnosed by a Neurologist or an Ear Nose & Throat Specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience.
